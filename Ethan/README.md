# Shape Wars

## Game Controls

### Movement

- "A" to move left
- "D" to move right

### Dodging

Dodging is a great way to avoid enemy attacks

- Press "Shift" to dodge backwards
- Hold any movement key and press "Shift" to dodge in that direction
- There is a 500 ms cooldown for dodging, so don't overuse it!
- Remember, you can't heal. So you better dodge incoming attacks!

### Perfect Dodge

To spice up the gameplay, perfect dodge was added

- Dodging right as the enemy flashes would slow down time and make the player perform some crazy moves, dealing massive damage
- This is hard to do though, as the flash window is very short

### Sprinting

Sprint is great for increasing movement speed

- Hold "Shift" to sprint

### Attacking

- Press "Space" to swing sword
- If an enemy is close enough, pressing "Space" will engage "Auto Attack", where the player will automatically zoom towards the enemy

## Game Mechanics

### Enemy Attacks

- Before any enemy attacks, one of their eye will flash red give warnings

### Progression

- Overtime, the game would get harder and harder
- Enemy damage would increase
- Enemy spawn rate will increase
- Enemy attack rate will increase

### End Goal

- There is no end goal! The only "goal" per se is to kill as many enemies as possible
- My best is 14 enemies, see if you can get higher than me
